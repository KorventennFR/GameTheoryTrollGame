DESCRIPTION :
*********************

This notebook is a simple implementation of the troll game as well as its solver using Nash equilibrum.

The rules are as follows: 

There are 2 players, each players have a certain amount of rocks and defend a castle. There is a Troll in between those castles.

The players can throw one, multiple or no rock each round. The troll moves towards the location that threw the less rocks at the last round by one step.
When one player has no more rocks the other throws all of his remaining rocks and the troll takes one step per rock towards the player with no rocks.
When both of the player are out of rocks, the troll goes to the nearest castle, the player of that castle loses the game.
